# Adding Components to Pipelines

Components are the building blocks of your ML pipelines in TangleML. This guide covers the different methods to add components to your pipeline workspace.


### Upload component file

Upload a YAML component file directly from your computer to add it to your user components library.

<ImageAnnotation src={require("./assets/AddingComponents_File.png").default} alt="Import from URL screenshot">

1. Click on the **File** option in the component panel
2. Select a YAML component file from your computer
3. The component will automatically be added to your **User Components** folder

</ImageAnnotation>


### Import from URL

Import components from publicly accessible URLs.

<ImageAnnotation src={require("./assets/AddingComponents_URL.png").default} alt="Import from URL screenshot">


1. Select the **URL** option.
2. Enter the publicly accessible URL to the YAML file.
3. The browser will automatically download and validate the component.
4. If valid, it will be added to your user components library.

:::tip
This method works great with raw GitHub URLs, allowing you to import components directly from repositories.

### In-app component editor

Create and edit Components directly in your browser using the [In-App Component Editor](/docs/component-development/in-app-editor):

<ImageAnnotation src={require("./assets/AddingComponents_New.png").default} alt="In-App Component Editor screenshot">

1. Click on the **New** button in the **Add component** dialog
2. Select the component template you want to use
3. The editor will open and you can start editing the component
4. Once you're done, click the **Save** button to save the component. The component will be added to your user components library.

### Drag and drop YAML files

Simply drag a YAML component file from your file system and drop it directly onto the canvas.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Import from other pipelines

Reuse components from your existing pipelines by importing them into your user components library.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### Using standard library components

Access components from the standard library for tasks shared within the TangleML instance:

<ImageAnnotation src={require("./assets/AddingComponents_StandardLibrary.png").default} alt="Import from standard library screenshot">

1. Expand the **Standard Library** folder in the left panel, **Components** section.
2. Select the component you want to add.
3. Drag the component onto the canvas.

:::tip
Components in the standard library are documented with implementation details you can inspect by clicking the component info dialog and checking the **Implementation** tab.

### Shared components library

Access components from the [shared components library](/docs/component-development/published-components-library) for tasks shared within the TangleML instance.
