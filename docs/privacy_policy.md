# Privacy Policy

There are two main modes of using Tangle:
* Deploying your own Tangle instance (e.g. running locally or creating your own HuggingFace Space)
* Using a Tangle instance maintained by the Tangle team (such as the Tangle team's shared HuggingFace Space [https://huggingface.co/spaces/TangleML/tangle](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TangleML/tangle))

The applicable privacy policy depends on which modes is used.

## Your own Tangle instance

When you install Tangle yourself, the Tangle team does not collect any personally-identifiable data from you (except the anonymized data currently collected by Google Analytics).
In the future we might add deactivatable anonymized telemetry to track which app features are used.

## Tangle instance maintained by the Tangle team

Example of such Tangle instance is the Tangle team's shared HuggingFace Space [https://huggingface.co/spaces/TangleML/tangle](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TangleML/tangle)).

When you interact (e.g. login, submit pipeline runs) with such Tangle instance maintained by the Tangle team,
the data that you provide to the app (such as the HuggingFace authentication info, submitted pipelines) is received and stored by the Tangle instance.
This is by design, since you're explicitly providing the data to the app to be processed and used by the app.
To be able to function, the app needs to store and use the provided data.

The data collected by the Tangle instances maintained by the Tangle team is covered by the following [Privacy Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy).
